## pNeuron Project ##

The pNeuron Project objective is create a powerfull but simple IDE to work with neural networks. See more and keep updated at http://www.agenciaprimeira.com.br/blog/.

## pNeuron IDE ##

> The objective of this neural network IDE is provide all the complexity of _one_ artificial intelligence algorithm through an easy-to-use interface. With a set of tools specially projected and developed aiming to create an enviroment where you can easily model, apply and maintain a neural network. A less academic way to deal with Neural networks enables the utilization of AI power in your commercial applications. Of course that all the data provided by pNeuron is also an envite to researches and studies in the area.
> What you can do with pNeuron:
    * Design the neural network layout using visual tools customizing several of it aspects.
    * Mantain trainning sets or import one from xml or Weka(r) format.
    * Train a neural network by applying a training set.
    * Monitorate and debug the learning process.
    * Analyze trough graphical tools several neural network aspects.
    * Publish a trained neural network as a .Net assembly to use in your application.
