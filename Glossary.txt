Domain
A set of all input values to the function.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(function)
In pNeuronIDE a domain is a set a range of values allowed in a input neuron. The pNeuronIDE has three predefined domains:Boolean (true or false, internally calculated as 0.1 and 0.9, respectively), Integer (Any integer number),  Float (decimal values between 0 and 1). To see about add customized domains go to Defining a Domin topic.

Trainning Set
In trainnig process the neural network need a set of facts which represets the knowledgmet. Each fact is a record with values to each input/output neuron.
