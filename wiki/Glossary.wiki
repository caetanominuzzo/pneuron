  *=== Domains (DOMp, DOMu, DOMn) ===
Conversion tables between a name and a float value. Could be stored as pre-defined domains, as a user-domain or in the NN document.

  *=== Neural Network (NN) ===
A collection of Neurons linked by Synapses. It's represented by NNGR.

  *=== Neural Network Graphic Representation (NNGR or NN Model) ===

It's a graphical tool to manipulate NN (Neurons and Synapses) and Neuron Groups.

  *===Neuron===
The node of a Neural Network model. Has a graphic representation on NNGR.

  *=== Neuron Group ===
A group of Neurons. Doesn't represent any NN entity. It's only on the graphical representation. Used to organize neurons.

  *=== Synapse ===
A link between two Neurons. Has a graphic representation on NNGR.

  *=== Training Set (TS) ===
Tabular data. Column represents Neurons. Rows represents Training Cases.
