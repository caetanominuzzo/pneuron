#summary The project glossary.

= Introduction =

This document was provided to define all terms and concepts utilized in the project documentation.

It's supposed to grow during architecture phase.


= Glossary =

===Neuron=== The node of a Neural Network model. Has a graphic representation in NNGR.
----
=== Synapse === A link between two Neurons. Has a graphic representation on NNGR.
----
=== Neural Network (NN) === A collection of Neurons linked by Synapses. It's represented by NNGR.
----
=== Neuron Group === A group of Neurons. Don't represents any NN entity. It's only in the NNGR. Used to organize neurons.
----
=== Neural Network Graphic Representation (NNGR or NN Model) === It's a graphical tool to manipulate NN (Neurons and Synapses) and Neuron Groups.
----
=== Training Set (TS) === Tabular data. Column represents Neurons. Rows represents Training Cases.
----
=== Domains (DTp, DTu, DTn) === Converions tables between an name and a float value.
